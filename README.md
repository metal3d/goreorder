# EXPERIMENTAL go source reoreding

This tool is EXPERIMENTAL! We strongly recommend to backup (or use git to commit your changes) before to try it.

This tool will "reorder" your sources to do this:

- alphabetic reorder you methods and constructors (constructors will be also placed above methods)
- place methods and constructors above the `type` definition
- rewrite (or output) the result

Usage:

```
Usage of goreorder:
  -dir string
    	directory to scan (default ".")
  -file string
    	file to process, deactivates -dir if set
  -format string
    	the executable to use to format the output (default "gofmt")
  -output string
    	output file (default to the original file, only works with -file)
  -reorder-structs
    	reorder structs by name (default: false)
  -verbose
    	get some informations while processing
  -version
    	show version (master)
  -write
    	write the output to the file, if not set it will print to stdout (default: false)
```

By default, the tool will scan everything in the current directory and output result to standard output (no write).


Examples of usage:

```bash
# show what will be generated
goreorder -dir foobar
```
